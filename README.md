This folder contains figures and the corresponding matlab codes for manuscript "Predictability in the northern Gulf of Mexico. Part II: freshwater pathways". Data can be obtained from the Dropbox link shown in the manuscript

Note, the ensemble names need to be double checked since the definition of "active" and "passive" are different from that of Part I.

Some intermediate datasets are not uploaded here due to relatively large file size, however, they are easy to be prepared, for example, relative vorticity, gradient calculation.
